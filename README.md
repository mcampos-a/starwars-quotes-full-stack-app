# Starwars Quotes App
Welcome to my corner of the internet. This project was born for my love of Starwars and the characters that bring it to life. In this full-stack app you can store quotes from your favorite Starwars characters. The app allows you to replace Yoda quotes from once that come from Darth Vader.

**Link to project:** placeholder

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB

To build this app I used vanilla JS for the client side and node.js with Express to build the server. It was really fun using mongoDB to add a remote storage component to this project. I got a chance to practice solid CRUD methods.


## Optimizations:

I had a lot of fun at the first pass to this project. I want to comeback and add some extra functionality. I want to add a button that removes the last quote to help the user clear the quote board. It would be cool to add a list of Starwars characters images that display next to the quotes.

## Lessons Learned:

This project allowed me to use my knowledge of front- and back-end programming. It was facinating to see how you can incorporate remote storage to the server side code. Having the ability to post and put to a database opens up the possibility for all kinds of interactions with users.
